things to look into:
css animations, css keyframes for changing card sizes

nav bar about link should display popup/modal with project member names
search function uses triposo api to query city names
i feel lucky button picks random city. from triposo list of cities?

id="recommendations", the recommendation boxes, uses preset cities listed as popular destinations
uses triposo predefined cities to refer to

be able to save previously searched destinations or persistent added cards on page

search function appends a new card to list of cards with the same functionality as the default cards

WHEN generated/on page, cards will display: country name, city name, picture representing city taken from triposo

WHEN clicked, card will expand to take up page, disappearing other cards on page.
information displayed will be: alternate, larger picture of city, 3 points of interest (with pictures?) and text describing them, weather info, time?

WHEN close button on expanded card is clicked, card will shrink down to initial size, other cards return to page where they were
