Project Description
During these trying Covid times, wouldn't you like to simulate being a Tourist?

1. Using this application,
2. We want to show a location of your choosing, or a location at random.
3. Weather information for that location
4. A randomized Street View from that location.
5. We want to display trivia about the location, (if time allows)
6. As a user, you can refresh to view new trivia and new street views.
   User Story
   AS AN eager traveler
